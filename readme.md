# **Process Management** 
## Process Defintion: 
procees is the unit of work in most systemes. Systems is consist of collection of processes execute user code all this processes may execute concurently.<br>
when a program is load to memory and aready for execution is called process.

## process state: 
a process state is current activity of that process. A process may be in one of the following states:

- **New**: the procees is beign created.<br>
- **Running**: instructions are being executed.<br>
- **waiting**: the process waiting for some event to occur(such as an I/O completion or reception signal).<br>
- **Ready**: the process is waiting to assigned to a processor.<br>
- **Terminated**: the process has finished execution.

## process control block: 
each process is reperesented is the operating system by a **process control block(PCB)**. It contains many pieces of information associated with a specific procees including these: 
- **Process State** : the state may be new, ready, running, waiting, terminated.
- **Process Counter** : the counter indicate the address of the next instruction to be executed for this process.
- **CPU Registers**: the registers vary in number and type, depending on the computer architecture. They include accumulators, index registers, stack pointers, and general-purpose registers, plus any condition-code information. Along with the program counter, this state information must be saved when an interrupt occurs, to allow the process to be continued correctly afterward.
- **CPU scheduling information**: This information includes a process priority, pointers to scheduling queues, and any other scheduling parameters.
- **Memory-management** information. This information may include such
items as the value of the base and limit registers and the page tables, or the
segment tables, depending on the memory system used by the operating
system

## threads Definition:
is the smallest set or sequence of instruction that computer or process can manage or execute.
a process can have mutiple threads

## process representation at linux: 

`
#include <linux/shced>
long state; /* state of process*/ 
long state; /* state of the process */
struct sched entity se; /* scheduling information */
struct task struct *parent; /* this process’s parent */
struct list head children; /* this process’s children */
struct files struct *files; /* list of open files */
struct mm struct *mm; /* address space of this process */
`

## shceduling queues 

- **Job Queue**: all the proceesses in the system.
- **Ready Queue** : all the processes are residing in main memory and are ready
  and waiting to execute are kept on list
- **Device queue** : the list of processes that wainting for particular I/O Device.

A process is initialy put in ready queue it waits there until it is selected
for execution, one the process is allocated the cpu is executing , one of
several events could occur: 

- the process could issue and I/O request and thene be palced in an I/O queue.
- the process could create new child process and wait for the child's termination.
- the process could be removed from the CPU forciply as result of interput and
  be put back in ready queue

The first two cases, the process eventually swithces from the waiting state to
ready state and us the put back to the **ready queue. A process continues this
cycle until it terminates, at which time it is removed from all queues and has
its PCB and resources deallocated.

## Shedulers 
process migrate among various scheduling queues throughout its lifetime.
### process types: 
- **I/Or-bound process**: is one the spend more of his time doing I/O than spends doing computations.
- **CPU-bound process**: is contrast generates I/O requests infrequently, using
  more of its time doing computations.<br>

### shedulers type: 
- **long-term-schedular**: his job is load a program from disk to ready queue main memory and responsable of multiprogramming degree(balance between I/O-bound process and CPU-process)
- **short-term-schedular(CPU-schedular)**: responsable from select among the process are ready to execute and allocate the CPU to one of them.
- ** the medium-term-schedular**: swap between processes between main memory and disk.

### shedulars approach
#### process schdulers approach in batch system:  
in batch systme, more prosesses are submitted than can be executed immediately.
these processes are spooled to mass storage device (disk) where they are kept
for later execution. **the long-term-scheduler** selects processes that are
ready in storage device and loads theme to memory for execution. **The
Short-term-scheduler** or **CPU sheduler** select among from among the
processes that are ready to execute and allocate the CPU to one of them.<br>
the **CPU sheduler (the short-term-scheduler)**  must select a process from memory and put in execution
and may execute for only few milliseconds. <br>
the **long-term-sheduler** executes much less frequently; minutes may separate
the creation of one new processthe long term-scheduler control **the degre of
multiprogramming**(the number of process in memory )  if the **degree of
multuprogramming** is stable then average rate of process creation creation
must be equal to average departure rate of processes leaving the system. the
the long-term shceduler may need to be invoked only when a process leaves the
system.<br>
It's imporatant for the **long-term-sheduler** to select the good mix process of CPU-bound and I/O-bound.
if all process in memory are I/O bound the ready queue will be almost aways empty and the short-term-schedularwill have a littel to do.<br>
if all process are **CPU-bound process** the I/O waiting queue(divice queue) will be almost always be empty, divexes will go unused, and again the system will be unbulanced. <br>
the system with the best perforamnce will thus have combination of CPU-bound and I/O-bound processes.


#### process shedulers OS(linux, windows)
the long-term-schedular maybe absent or minimal in linux and windows
time-sharing systems they have no long the long-term-schedular. they put every
new process in memory for the short-term-schedular. the stabilty of this system
depend on physicall limitation or the self adjusting nature of human users.

#### proceess approach of some others OS (swaping approach)
Some operating systems, such as time-sharing systems, may introduce an
additional, intermediate level of scheduling. This medium-term scheduler The
key idea behind a medium-term scheduler is that sometimes it can be
advantageous to remove a process from memory (and from active contention for
the CPU) and thus reduce the degree of multiprogramming. Later, the process can
be reintroduced into memory, and its execution can be continued where it left
off. This scheme is called swapping. The process is swapped out, and is later
swapped in, by the medium-term scheduler. Swapping may be necessary to improve
the process mix or because a change in memory requirements has overcommitted
available memory, requiring memory to be freed up. Swapping is discussed in 

## Context switch 
Switching the CPU to another process requires performing a state save of
the current process and a state restore of a different process. This task is known
as a context switch.

## process Operations 
### create procees 
look at file createProcess.c

### interprocess communication 
1- **independent processes**: the y cannot affect or be affected by the other
processes executing in the system.
2- **Cooperating processes**: they cann affect or be affect by the other
processes executing in the system.
### why we need process cooperation
1- information sharing
2- computation speedup
3- Modularity
4- Convenience
### models of interprocess communication 
1- **Shared memory**:  a region of memory that is shared by cooperating processes is stablished
2- **Message passing**: a communication take place by means of messages

exchanged between the cooperating processes.
